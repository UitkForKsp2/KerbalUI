# Kerbal UI

Unity project for the UI Toolkit theme and controls package based on Kerbal Space Program 2 (for use with the UITK for KSP 2 project).

## Deprecation notice

This archived repository contains the releases of the `kerbalui` bundle for UITK for KSP2 versions ≤ 2.2.0. The project has since been restructured and the releases
of the addressable bundles necessary for newer versions can be found in the [UitkForKsp2.Controls](https://github.com/UitkForKsp2/UitkForKsp2.Controls) repository,
while the Unity project has been integrated into the main [UitkForKsp2](https://github.com/UitkForKsp2/UitkForKsp2) repository.
